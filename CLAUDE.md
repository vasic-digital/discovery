## INHERITED FROM constitution/CLAUDE.md

All rules in `constitution/CLAUDE.md` (and the `constitution/Constitution.md` it references) apply unconditionally. This file's rules below extend them — they MUST NOT weaken any inherited rule. See parent root `CLAUDE.md` §6.AD for the Lava-specific incorporation context (29th §6.L cycle, 2026-05-14) and §6.AD-debt for the implementation-gap inventory. Use `constitution/find_constitution.sh` from the parent project root to resolve the absolute path of the submodule from any nested location.

## INHERITED FROM the Helix Constitution

This module is governed by the Helix Constitution. All rules in the
constitution's `CLAUDE.md` and the `Constitution.md` it references apply
unconditionally. Locate the constitution from any nested depth via its
`find_constitution.sh` helper — do NOT hardcode a path (this module stays
fully decoupled and project-agnostic per §11.4.28).

## Overview

`digital.vasic.discovery` is a standalone Go module for network and service discovery. It provides interfaces and implementations for scanning networks to find services, with an initial focus on SMB/CIFS share discovery via TCP port probing.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./... -count=1

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./... -count=1

# Run a single package's tests
go test -v ./pkg/scanner/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/smb/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/report/ -count=1

# Run a specific test
go test -v -run TestNewScanner_NilConfig ./pkg/smb/

# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Architecture

The module is organized into three packages under `pkg/`:

- **`pkg/scanner`** -- Core interfaces and types. Defines `Scanner` (interface), `Service` (discovered service), and `Config` (scanner configuration). All scanner implementations must satisfy the `Scanner` interface.

- **`pkg/smb`** -- SMB/CIFS discovery scanner. Implements `scanner.Scanner` by attempting TCP connections to SMB ports (445, 139) across a CIDR network range. Uses concurrent goroutines with a semaphore for controlled parallelism. Includes CIDR expansion utilities.

- **`pkg/report`** -- Report generation. Takes scan results and produces structured reports with JSON serialization and human-readable summaries. Groups discovered services by protocol.

### Adding a New Protocol Scanner

1. Create a new package under `pkg/` (e.g., `pkg/ftp/`).
2. Implement the `scanner.Scanner` interface: `Scan()`, `ScanHost()`, `Protocol()`.
3. Set protocol-appropriate default ports in the constructor.
4. Add tests covering: nil config, custom config, unreachable hosts, live listeners, context cancellation.

## Conventions

- **Go**: Constructor injection via `NewXxx(cfg)`, table-driven tests, `*_test.go` beside source files.
- **Error handling**: Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` for unwrapping.
- **Concurrency**: Use semaphore channels for limiting goroutines; respect `context.Context` cancellation.
- **Testing**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions. Spin up local TCP listeners for integration-style tests.

## Constraints

- No external dependencies beyond `stretchr/testify` for testing.
- No SMB protocol-level libraries; discovery is pure TCP port scanning.
- Context cancellation must be respected in all scan operations.
