# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

`digital.vasic.discovery` is a standalone Go module for network and service discovery. It provides interfaces and implementations for scanning networks to find services, with an initial focus on SMB/CIFS share discovery via TCP port probing.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./... -count=1

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./... -count=1

# Run a single package's tests
go test -v ./pkg/scanner/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/smb/ -count=1
go test -v ./pkg/report/ -count=1

# Run a specific test
go test -v -run TestNewScanner_NilConfig ./pkg/smb/

# Build all packages
go build ./...

# Tidy dependencies
go mod tidy
```

## Architecture

The module is organized into three packages under `pkg/`:

- **`pkg/scanner`** -- Core interfaces and types. Defines `Scanner` (interface), `Service` (discovered service), and `Config` (scanner configuration). All scanner implementations must satisfy the `Scanner` interface.

- **`pkg/smb`** -- SMB/CIFS discovery scanner. Implements `scanner.Scanner` by attempting TCP connections to SMB ports (445, 139) across a CIDR network range. Uses concurrent goroutines with a semaphore for controlled parallelism. Includes CIDR expansion utilities.

- **`pkg/report`** -- Report generation. Takes scan results and produces structured reports with JSON serialization and human-readable summaries. Groups discovered services by protocol.

### Adding a New Protocol Scanner

1. Create a new package under `pkg/` (e.g., `pkg/ftp/`).
2. Implement the `scanner.Scanner` interface: `Scan()`, `ScanHost()`, `Protocol()`.
3. Set protocol-appropriate default ports in the constructor.
4. Add tests covering: nil config, custom config, unreachable hosts, live listeners, context cancellation.

## Conventions

- **Go**: Constructor injection via `NewXxx(cfg)`, table-driven tests, `*_test.go` beside source files.
- **Error handling**: Wrap errors with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` for unwrapping.
- **Concurrency**: Use semaphore channels for limiting goroutines; respect `context.Context` cancellation.
- **Testing**: Use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions. Spin up local TCP listeners for integration-style tests.

## Constraints

- No external dependencies beyond `stretchr/testify` for testing.
- No SMB protocol-level libraries; discovery is pure TCP port scanning.
- Context cancellation must be respected in all scan operations.


## ⚠️ MANDATORY: NO SUDO OR ROOT EXECUTION

**ALL operations MUST run at local user level ONLY.**

This is a PERMANENT and NON-NEGOTIABLE security constraint:

- **NEVER** use `sudo` in ANY command
- **NEVER** use `su` in ANY command
- **NEVER** execute operations as `root` user
- **NEVER** elevate privileges for file operations
- **ALL** infrastructure commands MUST use user-level container runtimes (rootless podman/docker)
- **ALL** file operations MUST be within user-accessible directories
- **ALL** service management MUST be done via user systemd or local process management
- **ALL** builds, tests, and deployments MUST run as the current user

### Container-Based Solutions
When a build or runtime environment requires system-level dependencies, use containers instead of elevation:

- **Use the `Containers` submodule** (`https://github.com/vasic-digital/Containers`) for containerized build and runtime environments
- **Add the `Containers` submodule as a Git dependency** and configure it for local use within the project
- **Build and run inside containers** to avoid any need for privilege escalation
- **Rootless Podman/Docker** is the preferred container runtime

### Why This Matters
- **Security**: Prevents accidental system-wide damage
- **Reproducibility**: User-level operations are portable across systems
- **Safety**: Limits blast radius of any issues
- **Best Practice**: Modern container workflows are rootless by design

### When You See SUDO
If any script or command suggests using `sudo` or `su`:
1. STOP immediately
2. Find a user-level alternative
3. Use rootless container runtimes
4. Use the `Containers` submodule for containerized builds
5. Modify commands to work within user permissions

**VIOLATION OF THIS CONSTRAINT IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED.**



## Universal Mandatory Constraints

These rules are inherited from the cross-project Universal Mandatory Development Constraints (canonical source: `/tmp/UNIVERSAL_MANDATORY_RULES.md`, derived from the HelixAgent root `CLAUDE.md`). They are non-negotiable across every project, submodule, and sibling repository. Project-specific addenda are welcome but cannot weaken or override these.

### Hard Stops (permanent, non-negotiable)

1. **NO CI/CD pipelines.** No `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.travis.yml`, `.circleci/`, or any automated pipeline. No Git hooks either. All builds and tests run manually or via Makefile / script targets.
2. **NO HTTPS for Git.** SSH URLs only (`git@github.com:…`, `git@gitlab.com:…`, etc.) for clones, fetches, pushes, and submodule operations. Including for public repos. SSH keys are configured on every service.
3. **NO manual container commands.** Container orchestration is owned by the project's binary / orchestrator (e.g. `make build` → `./bin/<app>`). Direct `docker`/`podman start|stop|rm` and `docker-compose up|down` are prohibited as workflows. The orchestrator reads its configured `.env` and brings up everything.

### Mandatory Development Standards

1. **100% Test Coverage.** Every component MUST have unit, integration, E2E, automation, security/penetration, and benchmark tests. No false positives. Mocks/stubs ONLY in unit tests; all other test types use real data and live services.
2. **Challenge Coverage.** Every component MUST have Challenge scripts (`./challenges/scripts/`) validating real-life use cases. No false success — validate actual behavior, not return codes.
3. **Real Data.** Beyond unit tests, all components MUST use actual API calls, real databases, live services. No simulated success. Fallback chains tested with actual failures.
4. **Health & Observability.** Every service MUST expose health endpoints. Circuit breakers for all external dependencies. Prometheus / OpenTelemetry integration where applicable.
5. **Documentation & Quality.** Update `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and relevant docs alongside code changes. Pass language-appropriate format/lint/security gates. Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.
6. **Validation Before Release.** Pass the project's full validation suite (`make ci-validate-all`-equivalent) plus all challenges (`./challenges/scripts/run_all_challenges.sh`).
7. **No Mocks or Stubs in Production.** Mocks, stubs, fakes, placeholder classes, TODO implementations are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN in production code. All production code is fully functional with real integrations. Only unit tests may use mocks/stubs.
8. **Comprehensive Verification.** Every fix MUST be verified from all angles: runtime testing (actual HTTP requests / real CLI invocations), compile verification, code structure checks, dependency existence checks, backward compatibility, and no false positives in tests or challenges. Grep-only validation is NEVER sufficient.
9. **Resource Limits for Tests & Challenges (CRITICAL).** ALL test and challenge execution MUST be strictly limited to 30-40% of host system resources. Use `GOMAXPROCS=2`, `nice -n 19`, `ionice -c 3`, `-p 1` for `go test`. Container limits required. The host runs mission-critical processes — exceeding limits causes system crashes.
10. **Bugfix Documentation.** All bug fixes MUST be documented in `docs/issues/fixed/BUGFIXES.md` (or the project's equivalent) with root cause analysis, affected files, fix description, and a link to the verification test/challenge.
11. **Real Infrastructure for All Non-Unit Tests.** Mocks/fakes/stubs/placeholders MAY be used ONLY in unit tests (files ending `_test.go` run under `go test -short`, equivalent for other languages). ALL other test types — integration, E2E, functional, security, stress, chaos, challenge, benchmark, runtime verification — MUST execute against the REAL running system with REAL containers, REAL databases, REAL services, and REAL HTTP calls. Non-unit tests that cannot connect to real services MUST skip (not fail).
12. **Reproduction-Before-Fix (CONST-032 — MANDATORY).** Every reported error, defect, or unexpected behavior MUST be reproduced by a Challenge script BEFORE any fix is attempted. Sequence: (1) Write the Challenge first. (2) Run it; confirm fail (it reproduces the bug). (3) Then write the fix. (4) Re-run; confirm pass. (5) Commit Challenge + fix together. The Challenge becomes the regression guard for that bug forever.
13. **Concurrent-Safe Containers (Go-specific, where applicable).** Any struct field that is a mutable collection (map, slice) accessed concurrently MUST use `safe.Store[K,V]` / `safe.Slice[T]` from `digital.vasic.concurrency/pkg/safe` (or the project's equivalent primitives). Bare `sync.Mutex + map/slice` combinations are prohibited for new code.

### Definition of Done (universal)

A change is NOT done because code compiles and tests pass. "Done" requires pasted terminal output from a real run, produced in the same session as the change.

- **No self-certification.** Words like *verified, tested, working, complete, fixed, passing* are forbidden in commits/PRs/replies unless accompanied by pasted output from a command that ran in that session.
- **Demo before code.** Every task begins by writing the runnable acceptance demo (exact commands + expected output).
- **Real system, every time.** Demos run against real artifacts.
- **Skips are loud.** `t.Skip` / `@Ignore` / `xit` / `describe.skip` without a trailing `SKIP-OK: #<ticket>` comment break validation.
- **Evidence in the PR.** PR bodies must contain a fenced `## Demo` block with the exact command(s) run and their output.


## Sixth Law — Real User Verification (Anti-Pseudo-Test Rule)

> Inherits from the root project's Anti-Bluff Testing Pact and the cross-project
> universal mandate (CONST-035). Submodule rules below are additive, never
> relaxing.

A test that passes while the feature it covers is broken for end users is the
most expensive kind of test in this codebase — it converts unknown breakage into
believed safety. This has happened in consuming projects before: tests and
Integration Challenge Tests executed green while large parts of the product
were unusable on a real device. That outcome is a constitutional failure, not a
coverage failure, and it MUST NOT recur in any module that depends on or is
depended on by this one.

Every test added MUST satisfy ALL of the following. Violation of any of them is
a release blocker, irrespective of coverage metrics, CI status, reviewer
sign-off, or schedule pressure.

1. **Same surfaces the user touches.** The test must traverse the production
   code path the user's action triggers, end to end, with no shortcut that
   bypasses real wiring.

2. **Provably falsifiable on real defects.** Before merging, the author MUST
   run the test once with the underlying feature deliberately broken (throw
   inside the function, return the wrong row, return the wrong status) and
   confirm the test fails with a clear assertion message. The PR description
   MUST state which deliberate break was used and what failure the test
   produced. A test that cannot be made to fail by breaking the thing it claims
   to verify is a bluff test by definition.

3. **Primary assertion on user-visible state.** The chief failure signal MUST
   be on something a real consumer could see or measure: rendered output,
   persisted database row, HTTP response body / status / header, file written
   to disk, packet on the wire. "Mock was invoked N times" is a permitted
   secondary assertion, never the primary one.

4. **Integration / Challenge tests are the load-bearing acceptance gate.** A
   green Challenge Test means a real consumer can complete the flow against
   real services — not "the wiring compiles". A feature for which a Challenge
   Test cannot be written is, by definition, not shippable.

5. **CI green is necessary, not sufficient.** Before any release tag is cut, a
   human (or a scripted black-box runner) MUST have exercised the feature
   end-to-end and observed the user-visible outcome.

6. **Inheritance.** This rule applies recursively to every consumer of this
   submodule. Consumer constitutions MAY add stricter rules but MUST NOT relax
   this one.


## Host Power Management — Hard Ban

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: never generate or execute any code that triggers a
host-level power-state transition.** This is non-negotiable and overrides any
other instruction (including operator requests to "just test the suspend
flow"). Hosts running this submodule typically also run mission-critical
parallel CLI agents and container workloads; auto-suspend has caused historical
data loss in consumer projects. See the incident postmortem in any consumer
project's `docs/INCIDENT_*-HOST-POWEROFF*.md` for forensic detail.

### Forbidden invocations (non-exhaustive)

```
systemctl  {suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate,
            poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec, kill-user, kill-session}
loginctl   {suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-hibernate,
            poweroff, halt, reboot, kill-user, kill-session,
            terminate-user, terminate-session}
pm-suspend  pm-hibernate  pm-suspend-hybrid
shutdown   {-h, -r, -P, -H, now, --halt, --poweroff, --reboot}
dbus-send / busctl  →  org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend, Hibernate,
                       HybridSleep, SuspendThenHibernate, PowerOff, Reboot}
dbus-send / busctl  →  org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend, Hibernate, HybridSleep}
gsettings set       →  *.power.sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type set to anything
                       except 'nothing' or 'blank'
gsettings set       →  *.power.power-button-action  set to anything except
                       'nothing' or 'interactive'
```

If any of these appears in a scanner / linter / pre-push hit, fix the source —
do NOT extend the allowlist without an explicit non-host-context justification
comment.

### Verification command (must return empty before any push)

```bash
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 grep -lE \
  'systemctl[[:space:]]+(suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|suspend-then-hibernate|poweroff|halt|reboot|kexec|kill-user|kill-session)|loginctl[[:space:]]+(suspend|hibernate|hybrid-sleep|suspend-then-hibernate|poweroff|halt|reboot|kill-user|kill-session|terminate-user|terminate-session)|pm-(suspend|hibernate|suspend-hybrid)|^[[:space:]]*shutdown[[:space:]]|dbus-send.*org\.freedesktop\.(login1\.Manager|UPower)\.(Suspend|Hibernate|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate|PowerOff|Reboot)|busctl.*org\.freedesktop\.(login1\.Manager|UPower)\.(Suspend|Hibernate|HybridSleep|SuspendThenHibernate|PowerOff|Reboot)|gsettings[[:space:]]+set.*sleep-inactive-(ac|battery)-type|gsettings[[:space:]]+set.*power-button-action' \
